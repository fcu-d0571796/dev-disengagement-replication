# Developer Disengagement in Open-Source Projects

This repository contains the full codebase and data processing pipeline for the master's thesis:

**"Multidimensional Analysis of Developer Disengagement in Open-Source Projects"**
by Chenyu Zhao, Politecnico di Milano, July 2025

---

##  Overview

This project investigates early indicators of developer disengagement in open-source software (OSS) communities using GitHub data. The study analyzes process-, product-, and people-level metrics to identify disengagement patterns and test causal relationships.

Key components include:

- Feature engineering from commits, issues, PRs, comments, and threads
- Temporal segmentation of activity
- Granger causality testing across behavioral signals
- Predictive modeling using logistic regression
- Visualizations: time series plots, network metrics...
