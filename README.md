**"Multidimensional Analysis of Developer Disengagement in Open-Source Projects"**
by Chenyu Zhao, Politecnico di Milano, July 2025

---

##  Overview

This study investigates developer disengagement in open-source communities by analyzing process-level, product-level, and communication-level behavioral metrics. We build temporal features from GitHub activity logs, construct social interaction graphs, and apply both Granger causality and logistic regression to understand and predict developer churn.

Key contributions:
- A multidimensional framework for detecting disengagement signals
- Aggregated monthly developer-level features
- Predictive modeling using rolling and delta features
- Social network analysis of developer communication patterns
